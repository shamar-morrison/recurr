Code style and structure

- Reuse components whenever available instead of making your own.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.
